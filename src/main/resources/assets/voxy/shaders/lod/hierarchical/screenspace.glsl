//All the screenspace computuation code, hiz culling + size/screenspace AABB size computation
// to determin whether child node should be visited
// it controls the actions of the traversal logic
//NOTEEE!!! SO can do a few things, technically since atm its split not useing persistent threads
// can use mesh shaders to do rasterized occlution directly with a meshdrawindirect, one per layer
//Persistent threads might still be viable/usable since the inital lods supplied to the culler are mixed level
// (basiclly the minimum guarenteed value, like dont supply a top level lod right in front of the camera, since that is guarenteed not to, never be that level)
// do this based on camera distance computation

//changing the base level/root of the graph for some nodes can be really tricky and incorrect so might not be worth it but it should help
// substantually for performance (for both persistent threads and incremental)







//Sets up screenspace with the given node id, returns true on success false on failure/should not continue
